# Travel Agency Operations: SQL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project contains an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) script written in SQL. The goal of this analysis is to evaluate a travel agency's internal operations, assess financial accuracy, and uncover macro-level business trends. By transforming, cleaning, and aggregating project data, this script prepares raw information for strategic decision-making and business intelligence (BI) dashboarding.

## Data Source
* Source: Kaggle
* Dataset: Travel Agency Project Data (Imported via CSV)

## Tech Stack
* Language: SQL (MySQL dialect)
* Techniques Utilized: Data Type Casting, Data Cleaning, Time Series Aggregation, Cross-Tabulation, Financial Variance Analysis, Standard Deviation (Risk Assessment).
* Downstream Tools: Designed to output clean datasets for Tableau or Power BI.

## Methodology & Analysis Phases
The SQL script (`Travel_agency_operations_eda.sql`) is broken down into 10 distinct phases:

1.  Database Setup & Data Import: Establishing the schema and loading the CSV data.
2.  Data Understanding: Initial volume checks and row counts.
3.  Data Preparation & Cleaning: Converting generic strings to `DATE` and `DECIMAL` types, checking for NULLs, and verifying data integrity against duplicates.
4.  Univariate Analysis: Analyzing the distributions of individual variables like Project Type and Project Status.
5.  Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis: Examining relationships, such as total revenue generated by different departments and revenue spreads across project roles.
6.  Time Series Analysis: Tracking project volume and revenue growth over years, as well as identifying peak seasonal months.
7.  Cross-Tabulation & Deep Dive Categorical Analysis: Deep diving into categorical intersections, like finding the most lucrative project types per audience segment, and identifying operational bottlenecks by mapping project statuses to specific departments.
8.  Financial Accuracy Metrics: Comparing actual vs. estimated revenues to determine forecast accuracy across different project categories and target audiences.
9.  Advanced Time Series: Rolling data up into standard fiscal quarters to assess macro-level business cycles.
10. Risk Assessment: Calculating the Standard Deviation of revenue by project type to identify the financial volatility/unpredictability of specific offerings.

## Key Business Questions Answered
* Which departments are driving the most revenue?
* What times of the year represent our peak seasons and highest revenue-generating months?
* How accurately is the agency forecasting revenue, and which teams are over/under-predicting?
* Which project types carry the highest financial risk (volatility)?
* Are there operational bottlenecks within specific departments based on project status pipelines?

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open your preferred SQL IDE (e.g., MySQL Workbench).
3. Run the initial `CREATE DATABASE travel_agency_db;` command.
4. Use the Table Data Import Wizard** to import your Kaggle CSV file into a table named `travel_agency_projects`.
5. Execute the queries sequentially to clean the data and generate insights.
6. Export the resulting tables to Tableau or Power BI for visualization.
